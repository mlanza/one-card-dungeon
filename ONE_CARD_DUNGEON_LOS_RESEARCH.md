# One Card Dungeon - Line of Sight Rules Research Document

## Executive Summary

This document compiles research from BoardGameGeek forums, official rulebooks, and community discussions regarding Line of Sight (LOS) rules in One Card Dungeon. The research reveals that while the basic LOS rule is clearly defined, there is limited additional designer clarification available in public forums.

## Official LOS Rule

From multiple sources including the official rulebook and Tabletopia rules:

**Core LOS Rule:** "If a line can be drawn from any corner of your tile to any corner of a Monster's tile, without passing through a wall tile or another Monster's tile, you have Line of Sight."

This rule applies during:
- Adventurer Phase (Attacks)
- Monster Movement Phase  
- Monster Attack Phase

#### Status: 
- Most threads returned "No answer found" or limited content
- This suggests either the threads have limited activity, restricted access, or have been removed/archived

### 2. Community Discussions Found

#### Reddit r/soloboardgaming (June 2024)
- **Thread:** "One Card Dungeon - Line of Sight Clarification"
- **User Question:** "Does the spider with two health have line of sight to my character with 6 health?"
- **Status:** Question posted with an image showing the game state, but no answers were captured in the available data
- **Image Available:** Shows a game scenario with player asking for LOS determination

#### Key Community Insight:
- Monsters DO block line of sight (confirmed from YouTube PnP overview video)

### 3. Official Sources Analysis

#### Rulebook Clarifications:
- LOS is consistently defined across multiple official sources
- The rule uses a "corner-to-corner" methodology
- Both walls and monsters block LOS
- Range is measured separately from LOS

#### Tabletopia Rules:
- Contains reference to a diagram showing "The Monster is at Range 5 (Red Line), and in Line of Sight (Green Line)"
- However, the actual diagram content was not accessible in the research

### 4. General LOS Principles (from BGG General Discussions)

While not One Card Dungeon specific, general dungeon crawler LOS discussions provide context:

**Common LOS Methods:**
- Corner-to-corner (used by One Card Dungeon)
- Midpoint-to-midpoint
- Any-to-any (most permissive)
- Room-based LOS

## Specific LOS Scenarios and Edge Cases

Based on the corner-to-corner rule, the following interpretations can be made:

### 1. Diagonal Situations
- LOS exists if ANY corner-to-corner line is unobstructed
- This is more permissive than center-to-center methods
- Partial obstruction by walls still allows LOS if clear corner paths exist

### 2. Monster Blocking
- Monsters explicitly block LOS to other monsters
- This can create "monster shields" tactical situations
- Order of monster attacks could matter based on positioning

### 3. Wall Interactions
- Walls completely block LOS paths that pass through them
- Corner-to-corner tracing allows more LOS around wall corners than center-based methods

## Research Limitations

### 1. Access Constraints
- Many BGG threads had limited accessible content
- Possible that designer clarifications exist in restricted areas or archived content

### 2. Image/Diagram Access
- Referenced diagrams (like the Tabletopia example) were not fully accessible
- Visual examples would greatly enhance understanding of edge cases

### 3. Recent Activity
- Most recent substantive discussions found were from 2024
- Limited designer presence in accessible forums

## Community Consensus (Where Available)

### 1. Core Rule Agreement
- All sources agree on the corner-to-corner definition
- No disputes found about the fundamental LOS mechanics

### 2. Monster Blocking Confirmation
- Multiple sources confirm monsters block LOS
- This appears to be universally understood and accepted

### 3. Range vs. LOS Distinction
- Clear understanding that range and LOS are separate requirements
- Range is measured by tile count, LOS by corner tracing

## Unanswered Questions

### 1. Specific Edge Cases
- How does LOS work with partial wall coverage?
- What happens with multiple monsters in complex formations?
- Are there any "grazing" rules for lines that just touch wall corners?

### 2. Designer Intent
- No found designer clarifications beyond the basic rule
- No FAQ sections or errata addressing LOS specifically

### 3. Tournament/Official Rulings
- No found official tournament guidance or complex scenario rulings

## Recommendations for Players

### 1. Follow Strict Corner-to-Corner
- Use the literal rule: trace from any corner to any corner
- If even one clear path exists, LOS is established

### 2. Document House Rules
- For ambiguous situations, agree on house rules beforehand
- Consider taking photos of complex LOS situations for consistency

### 3. Conservative Interpretation
- When in doubt, assume LOS exists (permissive approach matches corner-to-corner methodology)
- Remember that both walls AND monsters block LOS
